## 🔐 Setting Up Admin Access (REQUIRED)

2. **Visit**: <https://novabank-rose.vercel.app/setup-admin>
3. **Click**: "Create Super Admin" button
4. **Save the credentials** displayed on screen:
   - Email: `admin@danamonbk.com`
   - Password: `Admin@123456`
   - PIN: `1234`
   - Account Number: (will be generated)

### Step 2: Login to Admin Dashboard

1. Go to: <https://novabank-rose.vercel.app/login>
2. Enter email: `admin@danamonbk.com`
3. Enter password: `Admin@123456`
4. Enter PIN: `1234`
5. You'll be redirected to: <https://novabank-rose.vercel.app/admin>

### Step 3: Secure Your Application ⚠️

**CRITICAL SECURITY STEP**: After successfully logging in, delete the setup files:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/apple/nova

# Delete setup files
rm app/setup-admin/page.tsx
rm app/api/setup-admin/route.ts

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Remove admin setup files for security"
git push origin master
```

**Why?** The setup page allows anyone to see your admin credentials. Delete it immediately after use!
